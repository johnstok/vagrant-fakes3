# vagrant-fakes3

A trivial Vagrant configuration to run [fakes3](https://github.com/jubos/fake-s3) within a VM.

## Testing

You can use a file management tool such as [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io) to test that the VM is running ok. Note that for Cyberduck you'll need to install an [additional profile](https://trac.cyberduck.io/wiki/help/en/howto/s3) to allow S3 connections on ports other than 443.
